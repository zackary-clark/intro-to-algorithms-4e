As painful as it is to admit, it's been over a decade since I took an algorithms course. I can feel the rust built up from years of webdev that simply never requires flexing my math or, really, critical thinking muscles. It's past time to shake off that rust, and Introduction to Algorithms (fourth edition) appears to be a fantastic resource with which to rigorously do so.

I'll use go to implement data structures and algorithms in the text, and solve exercises and problems requiring code.
